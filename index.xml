Zig SHOWTIME is a live-streamed show that airs on Twitch where (mostly) members of the Zig community present on a topic and take questions from the viewers. I've never spoken publicly before. Don't worry, we accept first-time speakers and if you point out that you might need help, we'll be happy to support you. As of now we've aired 3 episodes and for a few of the speakers that was the first time they spoke publicly.</description></item></channel></rss>
