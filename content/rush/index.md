# Zig RUSH!
**Zig RUSH!** is an event occasionally hosted on Zig SHOWTIME to celebrate the Zig community.

During a **Zig RUSH!** you get 5 to 10 minutes to demo something that you're working on. 

It doesn't have to be finished, it doesn't need a slide deck, you just need to be able to explain what your goal is and show how far along you are, that's it.

**A microphone is required**, a webcam is appreciated, and you will need to share your screen using Discord, no other prerequisites. 

There's no signup system, you just need to be present in the [Zig SHOWTIME Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/B73sGxF) when the show goes live and wait your turn to come on the show to present your stuff.
