# Advent of Code 2020
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles.

I've added myself to our [private leaderboard](https://old.reddit.com/r/Zig/comments/jzdnyj/advent_of_code_2020_ziguana_leaderboard/), and I'm going to try to solve all challenges [live on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/kristoff_it). 

I heard it gets pretty hard going forward so let's see how far I can get.

I'll be doing a dedicated stream every day at the following time:

<p style="align-self: center;">
<strong>10am PST / 12pm CST / 1pm EST / 7pm UTC / 8pm CET</strong> 
</p>

Ideally, it's going a 20 minute adventure, Ziggy: we get in, solve the challenge, and then come back.

As soon as I solve the challenge *(or give up?)* I'll end the stream.

I hope to see there a few people interested in learning more Zig!
